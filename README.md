# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Input the number of variables n and augmented matrix a[n][n+1].

2.Perform forward elimination to transform the matrix into upper triangular form.

3.Apply back substitution to solve for unknowns starting from the last equation.

4.Print the solutions for all unknowns.

## Program:
```

## Output:
![gaussian elimination]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
